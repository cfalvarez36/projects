There are going to be several projects that unfortunately, you will not be able to run, or see any results. 
The reason for this is to protect the identity of the client's who's information is being used. 
There are a set of files that are being read which consists of client's Date of Birth, Full Name, Address, Social Security Number and more. Originally, I wanted to use a random number generator to replace the SSN, and display results, but that does not eliminate the issue of displaying other sensitive information. The most efficient way to deal with this is to not show it at all. I apologize for this inconvenience and I hope the code attached is sufficient enough to understand what is going on. 


Also, in a couple of the projects, there are three excel files that I end up cleaning and merging together. To remove any redudancy, I will be cleaning and merging them on one project (Fuzzy_Match_Github), export that cleaned data onto a new .csv file (AllVendor.csv), and will be referring to this new .csv file in projects where it is necessary (Cleanup_Github). 


For one project (Payroll By Borough & Math), the final interactive visual isn't being shown on GitHub. However, when used on Jupyter Notebook, the output comes out as desired. As a result, I will be attaching a GIF of the visual in action.
